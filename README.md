# orb-based-tongue-print-biometric
The study proposes a system for recognizing tongue prints that can utilize the Oriented FAST and Rotated Brief (ORB) image processing algorithm. The main goal of this study is to create a tongue print biometric system that utilizes the ORB algorithm for feature extraction. The system acquires the image of tongue prints using a Raspberry Pi Camera. Subsequent to acquired images, the system uses the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image preprocessing. ORB feature extractor is afterward used to extract the features of the images. Following the extracted features, the ORB is used to compute the image descriptors and store the descriptors in a database along with the information of the user. The Python programming language is used in the system to navigate through the database and find the user information. The system included thirty (30) test subjects. The determined overall accuracy during testing was 90.33%. During the test on authentic users, the determined overall average recognition time speed of the tongue print biometric was 10.087 and the determined overall average recognition time speed when the biometric system was tested on an impostor was 10.1551 seconds.
